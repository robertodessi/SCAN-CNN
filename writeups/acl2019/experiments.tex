\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:intro}

We conducted three different experiments where we evaluated the accuracy of the models in terms of how many test commands were exactly translated
into corresponding test actions. Unless otherwise stated, averagy across 5 different runs and standard deviation is reported.

In order to make our results comparable with previous work on SCAN each training set consists of 100K examples sampled with replacement
from each related train/test split.
