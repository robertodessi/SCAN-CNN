\section{Introduction}
The advent of powerful deep neural network has rekindled the classic
debate on whether such models possess human-like abilities for
systematic, compositional generalization. \citet{Lake:Baroni:2017} and
\citet{Loula:etal:2018} have proposed the SCAN challenge to directly assess the ability of sequence-to-sequence
